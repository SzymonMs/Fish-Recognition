## Fish Recognition

In this project I created simple Desktop App (using Python PyQt5) to classification 8 species of polish fish. I created dataset using pictures from Google.
Next, I loaded all files to RoboFlow Platfrom, where I created labels to pictures. I used YOLOv8 algorithm to classify fish. It was my unviersity project in Artifficial Intelligencje and Biometry.
